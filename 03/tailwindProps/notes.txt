-> PROPS: 
    Props is a special keyword in React that stands for properties and is used for passing data from one component to another. Data with props are passed in a unidirectional flow from parent to child.


Example: 
import React from 'react';

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome name="Alice" /> 
      <Welcome name="Bob" /> 
    </div>
  );
}

1.App is the parent component.
2.Welcome is the child component.
3.name is a prop passed from App to Welcome.
4.Welcome uses the name prop to display a personalized greeting.
